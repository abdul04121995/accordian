          What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

            A Large Language Model is a type of AI trained on a massive amount
            of text to understand and generate human-like language. Its core
            capability is to recognize patterns in data and predict the most
            probable sequence of words, enabling it to write essays, answer
            questions, and perform many other language tasks.

          How do LLMs work on a fundamental level?
        </h1>
        <div class="accordian__para">
          <p class="accordian__para--wrapper">
            LLMs work by predicting the next most probable word in a sequence.
            They process a user's prompt by breaking it into "tokens" and then,
            based on their training data, iteratively select the next token.
            This process of continuous next-word prediction is how they
            construct coherent and contextually relevant responses.

          What is the Transformer architecture?

          <p class="accordian__para--wrapper">
            The Transformer is the core architecture behind modern LLMs. Its
            primary innovation is the "attention mechanism," which allows the
            model to weigh the importance of every word in a sentence
            simultaneously. This enables it to understand context and long-range
            relationships in text much more effectively than older AI models.

          <p class="accordian__para--wrapper">
            LLMs are trained in stages. First, they are pre-trained on vast text
            datasets to learn language patterns. Then, they are fine-tuned on
            smaller, specific datasets. The final crucial step is Reinforcement
            Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns the modelâ€™s
            outputs with human values and instructions

            LLMs have diverse applications, including content creation, like
            writing articles and marketing copy. They are also used for code
            generation, powering customer service chatbots, summarizing complex
            documents, and acting as personalized assistants. Their versatility
            makes them valuable tools in many different industries.
